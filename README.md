#0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO project that contains all tasks of the project

#Tasks
0. push, pall 
	Implement the push and pall opcodes.
1. pint 
	Implement the pint opcode.
	The pint opcode The opcode pint prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a   	  new line.
2. pop 
	Implement the pop opcode. The opcode pop removes the top element of the stack.
3. swap 
	Implement the swap opcode. The opcode swap swaps the top two elements of the stack.
4. add 
	Implement the add opcode. The opcode add adds the top two elements of the stack.
5. nop 
	Implement the nop opcode. The opcode nop doesnâ€™t do anything.
6. sub 
	Implement the sub opcode.

#The sub opcode

The opcode sub subtracts the top element of the stack from the second top element of the stack.
7. div 
	Implement the div opcode.

#The div opcode
	The opcode div divides the second top element of the stack by the top element of   	   the stack
8. mul 
	Implement the mul opcode.

#The mul opcode
	The opcode mul multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top element 	   of the stack
9. mod 
	Implement the mod opcode.

#The mod opcode
	The opcode mod computes the rest of the division of the second top element of the  	   stack by the top element of the stack.
10. comments 
11. pchar 
	Implement the pchar opcode.

#The pchar opcode
	The opcode pchar prints the char at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.
12. pstr
	mplement the pstr opcode.
#The pstr opcode
The opcode pstr prints the string starting at the top of the stack, followed by a new line.
13. rotl 
	Implement the rotl opcode.

#The rotl opcode
	The opcode rotl rotates the stack to the top.
14. rotr 
	Implement the rotr opcode.

#The rotr opcode
	The opcode rotr rotates the stack to the bottom.
15. stack, queue 
	Implement the stack and queue opcodes.

#The stack opcode
	The opcode stack sets the format of the data to a stack (LIFO). This is the default 	   behavior of the program.
16. Brainf*ck 
	Write a Brainf*ck script that prints School, followed by a new line.
17. Add two digits 
	Add two digits given by the user.
	Read the two digits from stdin, add them, and print the result
 	The total of the two digits with be one digit-long (<10)
18. Multiplication 
	Multiply two digits given by the user.

    Read the two digits from stdin, multiply them, and print the result
    The result of the multiplication will be one digit-long (<10)
19. Multiplication level up 
	Multiply two digits given by the user.
